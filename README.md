# Introduction to Pandas

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to import a CSV file into a Panda Dataframe 
- Use Pandas to calculate basic statistics ( Mean. Median, Mode, Range)
    - Single-Column basic statistics
    - Multi-Column basic statistics
    - Run Descriptive statics with Pandas
- Apply mean, median, and range to real-world situations


##  Code-Along File and Raw Data

Code Alongs are intended for you to work through the code with the instructor.  

Please download the Jupyter notebook file and the Height and Weight CSV.
